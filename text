Q.Explain Hadoop Deployment Layout in Brief.
Introduction:
Standard deployment layout for Hadoop:
•	Hadoop has deployment layout due to the increased complexity and developing Hadoop ecosystem.
•	Which pave the way for the betterment in the integration part of the Hadoop sub-projects.
•	Which helps to make the installation process much easier.
•	With the help of installation one can make the entry process easier and will tend to increase the adoption of the Hadoop.
Packages:
•	Each Hadoop is divided into number of packages in order to make them to operate independently to upgrade themselves.
The packages were divided into list and they include:
•	Hadoop Common:
•	They will include the native code which needs the jar files.
•	HDFS Client: a.) HDFS jars
b.)scripts.
c.)shared Libraries.
HDFS server: jsvc executable Yarn Client - Yarn client jars and scripts
Yarn Server - Yarn server jars and scripts 
MapReduce - MapReduce jars, scripts, and shared libraries LZO - LZ0 codec Metrics - Plugins for Chukwa and Ganglia.


Other team packages are:
	Pig
	Hive 
	Oozie 
	client Oozie server 
	Howl 
	client Howl server
•	PRM or RedHat is used to deploy these packages.
•	And again a package is needed which will depend upon the package versions.
•	In the new deployed layout one is capable of generating tarballs.
Deployment:
•	Instead of package manager it is necessary to have a standard deployment which results in package installation.
•	It is among the top level directories.
•	As well it contains the sample of each.
Path Configurations
•	Path configuration can be done at compile phase or installation phase.
•	RPM has the advantage over relocating the directory and helps for configuring the path at the installation phase.
•	In case, of Debian package the path can be configured even on the compile phase.
Build phase parameter:
•	package.prefix – package prefix location prefix (Default /usr).
•	package.conf.dir - configuration directory location (Default /etc/hadoop).
•	package.log.dir -  Log directory Location (Default /var/log/hadoop).
•	package.pid.dir - pid directory Location (Default /var/run/hadoop)
